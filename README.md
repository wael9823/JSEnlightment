# JSEnlightment Textbook Practice

Welcome everyone. I am learning Javascript from the textbook Javascript enlightment. This repository has some of the codes I practiced while
learning from the book along with unit testing using Jest. Please do reach out to me if there is anything I can help with. 

Thanks! Have a good day ahead.
